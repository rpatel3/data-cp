# Final Data Project ( NBA Predictions )
The dataset was found at http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2016.html#all_team_stats and collected on March 5, 2016. Using this dataset I extracted features to predict how many more wins a team would get for the remaining 2015-2016 NBA season. Project was done for an Intro to data science course at Cal Poly taken winter 2015.

Includes:
### 1. Introduction
Information about the dataset and project.

### 2. Data Cleaning
Merge data files, gathering information about each team.

### 3. Data Exploration
Finding features that would help my model predict which games in the future a team would win.

### 4. Modeling and MachineLearning
Used Random Forest Classifier to predict which team would win a game.

### 5. Presentation
Final presentation notebook with all significant parts of the project put together.
